# WebScraper
A web scraper project that scrapes all restaurants in a location. 
The project begins with scraping all the restaurants that are in london in Yelp.com

Then with string concatenation, I sorted the reviews by highest rated
The project would then select three restaurants with a review higher than 60. 

After the scraper selects three randomly which has 60 reviews,
It then finds out the 
Love rating = Five star/Total rating
around 1-2 negative reviews 
and 2-3 positive reviews.
